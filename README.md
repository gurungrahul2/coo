coo: online messaging service based on Flask.

In this project, I build an online messaging service using Flask, similar in spirit to Slack. Users will be able to sign into this site with a display name, create channels (i.e. chatrooms) to communicate in, as well as see and join existing channels. Once a channel is selected, users will be able to send and receive messages with one another in real time.
